Meta4 is a simple DB schema for Metagenomic protein domain annotations

Meta4 was developed and tested on an Amazon EC2 micro instance of a CloudBioLinux image.  It should work on any standard LAMP server.  It has not been tested on Windows or MacOS.

Requirements:
Apache
MySQL
Perl

Perl Modules:
BioPerl
IO::String
HTML::Table
DBI
Getopt::Long
Bio::Graphics
GD
File::Basename

INSTALLATION OF EXAMPLE DATBASE:

1) download and unzip/untar the archive from github or clone the repository from https://github.com/mw55309/meta4

2) create a MySQL database and read/write accounts

	# command prompt
	mysqladmin -u root -p create meta4

	# within MySQL
	grant all on meta4.* to 'writeaccount'@'localhost' identified by 'writepass';
	grant select on meta4.* to 'readaccount'@'localhost' identified by 'readpass';

3) create the database structure

	# command prompt
	mysql -u root -p meta4 < sql/meta4.mysql.sql

4) edit the file scripts/META4DB.pm and enter the account details for the write account

5) load information information into the database

	# command prompt
	# load sample
	perl scripts/load_SAMPLE.pl --name 'A test sample' --desc 'A completely made up sample from the dragon gut microbiome'
	# Output: Inserted sample with id: 5

	# load assembly
	perl scripts/load_ASSEMBLY.pl --sample_id 5 --assembly_params examples/assembly_parameters.txt --desc 'SOAPdenovo assembly'
	# Output: Inserted assembly with id: 6

	# load contigs.  Identifiers in fasta file should be unique within the assembly
	perl scripts/load_CONTIG.pl --assembly_id 6 --file examples/contigs.fasta
	# Output: Inserted 4 contigs
	
	# load gene predictions.  
	# Three files are required:
	#	- gff/gtf file of gene locations.  First column should contain a sequence identifier from a contig (above). Second and third columns are ignored
	#					   Fourth, Fifth and seventh columns are start, end and strand (+/-) of the gene respectively.  All other columns
	#					   of the GFF/GTF are ignored.
	#	- nucleotide fasta file.	   FASTA file of nucleotide sequences.  Same order as the GFF/GTF file.
	#	- proteins fasta file.	   	   FASTA file of protein sequences.  Same order as the GFF/GTF file.
	perl scripts/load_PREDICTIONS.pl --assembly_id 6 --gff examples/predictions.gff --nucfile examples/nucs_out.fasta --profile examples/prots_out.fasta
	# Output: Inserted 698 gene predictions

	# load domain database
	perl scripts/load_DOMAINDB.pl --name Pfam-A --version 26.0 --file Pfam-A.hmm --desc 'Pfam-A version 26.0'
	# Output: Inserted domain DB with id: 1

	# load domains
	# A file of domains is required.  Text file, tab-delimited, four columns (no title)
	# First column: accession number; second column: domain name; third column: domain length; fourth column: domain description
	perl scripts/load_DOMAINS.pl --domain_db_id 1 --file examples/domains_hit.txt
	# Output: Inserted 757 domains

	# load hits from a pfam_scan.pl results file
	# It is assumed that: i) the query identifier is the same as the ID in the gene prediction fasta files; and ii) the hit identifier is the accession from the domain database
	# The script loads domains from the given domain database, and gene predictions from the given assembly
	perl scripts/load_PFAMSCAN.pl --domain_db_id 1 --assembly_id 1 --file examples/pfam_scan.out
	# Output: Inserted 1633 domain matches
	
6) edit the file cgi_scripts/META4DB.pm and enter the account details for the read account

7) copy the entire contents of cgi_scripts/ to your cgi-bin and make them readable and executable by your apache user. 

8) Navigate to http://www.yourservername.com/cgi-bin/mate4.cgi
